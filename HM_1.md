This document defines the requirements for the procedure of implementing measures related to the creation, 
development, commissioning, operation, and decommissioning of state information systems (hereinafter referred to as the "system"),
and the further storage of information contained in their databases. These measures are carried out by state authorities, 
including federal executive bodies, executive bodies of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, management 
bodies of state extra-budgetary funds, and other state bodies (hereinafter referred to as "state bodies") in order to 
improve the efficiency of the exercise of powers by state bodies through the use of information and communication technologies; 
or by state bodies acting on behalf of public partners and private partners in accordance with public-private partnership agreements 
(hereinafter referred to as the "private partner") for the implementation of said agreements; or by state bodies acting on behalf of 
concedents and concessionaires in accordance with concession agreements (hereinafter referred to as the "concessionaire") for the 
implementation of said agreements; as well as by public-law companies and state corporations authorized to carry out measures for 
the creation, development, and operation of state information systems for other purposes established by federal laws 
(hereinafter referred to as "authorized organizations").

1(1). When state bodies, private partners, concessionaires, or authorized organizations implement measures 
for the creation, development, commissioning, operation, and decommissioning of systems and the further 
storage of information contained in their databases, the following must be complied with:

a) requirements for the protection of information contained in systems, as established by the federal 
executive body in the field of security and the federal executive body authorized in the field of 
countering technical intelligence and technical protection of information, within their powers;

b) requirements for the organization and measures for protecting information contained in the system;

c) requirements for the protection of personal data provided for by Part 3 of Article 19 of the Federal Law 
"On Personal Data" (in case the system contains personal data). To fulfill the information protection 
requirements provided for in clause 1(1) of this document (hereinafter referred to as "information protection 
requirements"), state bodies, as defined in accordance with the regulatory legal act governing the functioning 
of the system, shall determine the requirements for the protection of information contained in the system of the 
state body or authorized organization. For this purpose, they shall carry out:
a) identification of information subject to protection from unauthorized access, destruction, modification, 
blocking, copying, provision, dissemination, as well as other unlawful actions regarding such information;
b) analysis of regulatory legal acts, methodological documents, and national standards that the system must 
comply with;
c) classification of the system in accordance with information protection requirements;
d) identification of information security threats, the realization of which could lead to a 
breach of information security in the system, and the development of an information security threat model based on them;
e) determination of requirements for the information system (subsystem) for the protection of 
information contained in the system.

1(3). The creation, development, commissioning, operation, and decommissioning of systems and the 
further storage of information contained in their databases shall be carried out taking into account 
the methodological recommendations on the composition, structure, and content of organizational, 
methodological, technical, mathematical, software, informational, documentation, legal, and other 
types of support for systems. These recommendations are approved by the presidium of the Government 
Commission for Digital Development and the Use of Information Technologies to Improve the Quality of 
Life and Conditions for Doing Business. The development of said methodological recommendations, 
including their submission for consideration and approval to the Government Commission for Digital 
Development and the Use of Information Technologies to Improve the Quality of Life and Conditions for
Doing Business, is carried out by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media of 
the Russian Federation.

Methodological recommendations approved in accordance with the first paragraph of this clause 4 shall 
be published by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media of the Russian 
Federation on the portal of the federal state information system for coordination of informatization 
within a period not exceeding 5 working days from the date of their approval.

1(4). For the purposes of this document, the following concepts are used:
*   "Iteration" means a set of works provided for by the stages of system creation (system phase), 
starting from the stage of software development or adaptation, development of working documentation for 
the system or its part, and concluding with the stage of pilot operation of the system, aimed at implementing 
specific requirements for the system (system phase) and obtaining one or several functions (tasks, complexes of tasks) 
implemented by the system (hereinafter referred to as the "requirement group"), as specified in the technical 
specification for the creation of the system (system phase);
*   "Iterative development approach" means an approach based on performing the necessary number of iterations to 
find and implement the most effective technical, ergonomic, and (or) technical-economic solutions for creating the 
system (system phase);
*   "System phase" means a target state of the system for which a set of functions and (or) tasks implemented 
by the system is defined.

The terms "information system lifecycle", "technical documentation", "methodological documentation", 
"free software", "distribution kit", "client software of an information system", "software interface 
of an information system", "model", "electronic model", "model of automated activity processes", 
"information system architecture model", "information system database model", "methodological document on modeling", 
used in this document, are applied in the same meanings as defined in the Regulation on the National 
Fund of Algorithms and Programs for Electronic Computers, approved by Decree of the Government 
of the Russian Federation No. 62 of January 30, 2013 "On the National Fund of Algorithms and
Programs for Electronic Computers" (hereinafter referred to as the Regulation on the National Fund of Algorithms and Programs).
(Clause 1(4) as amended by Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation No. 2338 of December 16, 2022)

## эссе на тему документа "постановление правительства №676"

```
Рассмотренный документ является очень подробной инструкцией по разработке, 
эксплуатации и выводе из неё информационных систем, разрабатываемых в Российской Федерации. 
Документ имеет множество редакций и дополняется каждый раз по мере необходимости.
Текст документа отвечает на богатый список вопросов, о которых думают разработчики 
информационных систем: каким требованиям должна отвечать система, как хранить данные 
различного вида, какие меры безопасности должны быть встроены в систему, правильный вывод из эксплуатации.
Как любой официальный документ: ГОСТ, методические указания - он несёт в себе чётко 
сформулированную позицию Государства по отношению к рассматриваемому в документе вопросу. 
Без подобных документов было бы крайне сложно систематизировать всю информацию, что хранится в 
других системах по всей стране и которыми пользуется Государство. Следование указаниям из 
документа в значительной степени облегчит жизнь разработчикам, работающим на Государство, 
снабдив их исчерпывающим перечнем мер и требований к системам на самых первых этапах её разработки, начиная с идеи и концепции.
